#Prototype
## By:- Aditya Gupta

---

Using PHP and MySQL create a basic prototype for your open data application. Your prototype should have the following features:

    1.Fake data in your MySQL database.
    2.A page that lists all the places.
    3.A single page with more details for individual places.
    4.An admin section where you can add, edit, and delete places. (Your admin section will be publicly accessible right now.)
    5.Admin section should contain all the appropriate validation.
