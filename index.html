	<h4>Description & feature list:</h4>
	<p><i>"Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food and medicine for the soul."</i>
	Luther Burbank</p>
	<p>Your day is enhanced upon visiting a garden, whether it is the pools of fresh air that go in your lungs or the fragrance of the flowers. For this very reason, Ottawa City has various Community Gardens cultivated across the city to enrich the life of it's settlers. Imagine the sound of your children jumping and playing, the sight of beautiful birds passing by, or just the smiling faces of the passers.</p>
	<p>We have developed a very user friendly App which will help you with the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Locating the nearest community garden to your location.</li>
		<li>Address of the Community Garden.</li>
		<li>Average User Rating</li>
		<li>Listing various other Community gardens.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Administrators of App will be provided a username and password. Upon logging on they will have the benefit of adding, editing or deleting any of the community gardens listed in the database.</p>

	<h4>User Persona: Meetal Aryan</h4>
	<p>Of varied things, Meetal is a mother, wife and an employee. A community garden is an absolutely essential part of her life. As a mother, it is her duty to bring her children to the garden for physical activity and socialisation. As a wife, it is her duty to bring her husband to the garden to have a pump of fresh air and bask in the sun of secret romance. As an employee, a garden brings the much needed relief from stress to her busy life. Meetal loves her Community Garden App which helps her to locate the nearest garden. If she is bored of visiting the usual one, the app helps her locate other good reviewed gardens nearby too. Seldom she takes to rating the gardens for the benefit of others like herself.</p>
